# Bootstrap Project

This purpose of this project was to practice using Bootstrap by creating [Newsweek's homepage](http://www.newsweek.com).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/using-bootstrap).

## Post-Project Thoughts

1) I realized partway through that I was using Bootstrap 4, which is a recently released beta. I read [this article](https://blog.templatetoaster.com/bootstrap-3-vs-bootstrap-4-migrate-differences/) about Bootstrap 3 vs 4. I concluded that I need to use Bootstrap 3 because it is much more widely adopted and I just didn't like the docs or concept of Bootstrap 4 (which added flexbox). The way I see it, Bootstrap 4 took all the flexbox CSS and just put it into HTML classes as roughly inline styling.. which is not a good practice. Plus it deviates from some of the concepts of flexbox like the concepts of how rows/columns work. For this reason, I don't like Bootstrap 4.
